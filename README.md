## ⚙️ Workflow

### 1. Development

* All development happens inside the `/src` folder.
* Each route (page) is defined in `/pages`.
* UI sections are built as components inside `/components`.

### 2. Component Design

* Modular and reusable components are used.
* Each component is scoped by page type (e.g., `/components/vendors`).

### 3. Styling

* Global styles go into `globals.css`.
* Component-level styles use `.module.css` or `.scss` for modularity.

### 4. API & Data

* All data fetching logic is abstracted inside `/services`.
* Uses `fetch` or `axios` for REST APIs.

### 5. State Management

* React Context API is used for global state (`/context`).
* Hooks are used for local or reusable logic (`/hooks`).

### 6. Typescript & Type Safety

* Strongly typed using `.d.ts` files inside `/types`.

## 🔭 Application Guidelines

* **Background**: Set as the main backdrop for the entire web app.
* **Text Primary**: Use for titles, body copy, and all foreground text for clarity and accessibility.
* **Accent 1**: Apply for all primary action buttons (e.g., "Buy Now", "Invest") and emphasize important content.
* **Accent 2**: Use for secondary buttons, info cards, and labels to bring visual variety while staying accessible.
* **Success**: Green tones indicate successful user actions like form submissions, vendor approvals.
* **Warning**: Coral tones highlight errors, validations, or limited-time announcements.

## 💡 Notes

* All colors are optimized for dark-mode interfaces.
* Maintain at least a **4.5:1 contrast ratio** between text and background to ensure readability and WCAG compliance.
* Limit use of Accent colors to retain visual hierarchy and clarity.
